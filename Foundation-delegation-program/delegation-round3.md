# Aura Network Foundation Delegation Round 3

This document presents the Aura Network Foundation Delegation Program round 3. If you have good suggestions, there are several channels where we are online almost all the time:

- Aura Network [Discord](https://docs.aura.network/validator/running-a-fullnode): either tag us on the main or dm @eledra or @kienvc.
- Twitter: [@EledraNguyen](https://twitter.com/EledraNguyen)
- If you have access to the shared version of the document on Google docs, please just comment on it.

## 1. Context

It has been 5 months since the second round of Aura Foundation delegation (July 2023). As we already announced before, there will be re-evaluated foundation delegation each 3 months. However, the delay happened because recently, most of our resources are focused on building app layer, releasing new products.

During this time, 3 proposals were submitted:
- [Proposal #5](https://aurascan.io/votings/5) set inflation rate to 5%
- [Proposal #6](https://aurascan.io/votings/6) spent Nois token from Community Pool for randomness DApps 
- [Proposal #7](https://aurascan.io/votings/7) upgraded mainnet to v0.7.1 with many new features   

We acknowledged all contributions by validators and we are taking all of them into account for the third round of Foundation Delegation from Aura Network.

## 2. Current Network Status

We present the current delegation status of the network in this [sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oCaf5vKvFV-AzoFyVxHCsJWRTmdqHiU-Cl38zgnesHE/edit#gid=1976583494).

After 9 months of launching, the network status is quite stable now. Most users have migrated their tokens from BSC to Aura native. As we evaluate, the current APY is reasonable for network health. Then there will not be many changes with current delegation status.   

## 3. Round 3 Foundation Delegation Criteria

Here is some details of the round 3 foundation delegation program:

- There are 3 base tiers of delegation:
  - Big delegation: 2M Aura per validator. Validators must set their commission between 3% to 5% to maintain this delegation.
  - Medium delegation: 500K Aura per validator. Validators must set their commission level between 1% and 8% to maintain this delegation.
  - Small delegation: 100K Aura per validator. Validators must set their commission between 0.5% and 10% to maintain this delegation.

- Some parameters are used to evaluate validator performance:  
  - Be soft slashed during delegation round 2
  - Downtime after network upgrade [#7](https://aurascan.io/votings/7)
  - Participate in network governance **#6** and **#7**
  - Infrastructure support: IBC relayer, snapshot
  - Active social contribution
  - Validator who belongs to organization that are directly working with Aura team to build products

  Depend on these parameters, the delegation amount will be re-calculated base on the base tiers.
- All rewards to the Staked tokens from the Aura Foundation WILL be moved to the community pool. Aura team WILL not take any rewards from staking.
- Rotate Euphoria validator set. 15 validators receive a big foundation delegation will have to run Euphoria nodes to replace the current set.
- During the delegation period, we will increase delegation amount case by case when we need support such as creating new IBC channels, cooperate building products.   

## 4. Dispute & suggestion

Currently there is significant effort to review and maintain a good delegation program. We encourage every validators to contribute and propose new delegation criterias, frameworks to improve our foundation delegation program. If there is any disagreement on the current delegation decision, we are also open to discuss.

## 5. Maintaining delegations

The proposed list of delegation for round 3 is [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oCaf5vKvFV-AzoFyVxHCsJWRTmdqHiU-Cl38zgnesHE/edit#gid=1734295646).

For transparency purposes, validators receiving the delegation are required to public the pledge based on their contribution commitment at [Github repository](https://github.com/aura-nw/mainnet-artifacts/tree/main/Foundation-delegation-program). During the delegation program, validators have to regularly update their progress to the repository.

Aura team and advisors will base on that to reevaluate the candidates every 3 months. Depending on their status, we will decide to maintain or terminate the delegation.

**DEADLINE for updating pledge and commission rate: December 6th, 2023 23:59 UTC**

**IMPORTANT:**

*- EVERY VALIDATOR who receive delegation must re-submit your pledger.*

*- Please make sure you update your pledge and appropriate commission rate to maintain your delegation*


## 6. Euphoria testnet maintenance

The list of validator who run Euphoria testnet is published with the delegation decision.

Validators who tagged with **new** in the **Euphoria Testnet** column must run a testnet validator node.

## 7. Terms and Conditions

- Every validator is welcome to apply for the Foundation Delegation Program.
- The Aura Network team reserves the right to change these terms and conditions at any time without prior notice.
- All final decisions of the program belong to the Aura Network team.
